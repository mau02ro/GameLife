      <h1>Game of Life</h1>
      <p>
        It is a zero-player game, which means that its evolution is determined
        by the initial state and does not require any subsequent data entry. The
        "game board" is a flat mesh made up of squares (the "cells") that
        extends infinity in all directions. Therefore, each cell has 8
        "neighboring" cells, which are next to it, including the diagonal ones.
        Cells have two states: they are "alive" or "dead" (or "on" and "off").
        The state of the cells evolved over discrete units of time (I could say
        in turns).
